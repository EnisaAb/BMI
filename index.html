<h4 class="text1">What is BMI ?</h4>
<p>Body mass index or BMI is a simple and widely used method 
    for estimating body fat mass. BMI was developed in the 19th 
    century by the Belgian statistician and anthropometrist<i> Adolphe Quetelet</i>. BMI is an accurate reflection 
    of body fat percentage in the majority of the adult population.
    BMI in an individual is calculated by the use of a mathematical formula.
     It can also be estimated using tables in which one can match height 
     in inches to weight in pounds to estimate BMI.
      In this page you can find a calculator for a easy way for you to calculate 
      your BMI ,and in base of your gender and of your specific height there is a note 
      that tells you the perfect weight you should have for a healthy BMI.</p>
      <p> There is a mathematical formula that allows us to calculate it.
         <br> <strong>The formula is - BMI = (Weight in kilograms) divided by (Height in metres squared)
         <br> BMI=weight/height <sup>2</sup>   </strong>
